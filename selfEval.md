# Self Evaluation

- Reflect on your time management and awareness of where you spend time. Is this a strength or area you are working on? What support do you need in this area? And/or, what tips do you have to share with your classmates in this area?
**An area I am working on for sure. I am still determining when it's best to just ask for help, or keep trying to figure it out. I have always been better at working later, which isn't good when things are due at 8pm, so something I need to keep working on.**
- How would you explain to a 5 year old what a function is?
**A function is a set of instructions like for a new toy. You need the instructions to make it work, but you cannot just look at the instructions, you need follow and do them.**
- Share your understanding of arguments and parameters.
**Paramters are what set up the function. Arguments are called in the end. They both need to have the same amount of data.**
- What questions/topics (related to Functions) do you want to being to your Small Group?
**Still a little confused with the purpose of *return* and when to use it.**
